# Minimalistic Games

When im pored i like to have something to tinker with, and i also wanted to be able to have an interactive site without the need to run anything yourself.

For this purpose i set up this repo where the idea is that i can add/tweak games using React. Everything is then published to the [GitHub Pages page](https://sutne.github.io/games). I also wanted some form of backen d and decided i coould just use the Firebase firestore solution for that.
